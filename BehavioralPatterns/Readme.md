# Behavioral Patterns

They are used to encapsulate variation.

* [Chain Of Responsibility](ChainOfResponsibility)
    * More than one obj can handle a request that is passed along the chain.
* [Command](Command)
    * It is used package the command we want to execute in a obj that is decoupled from the
sender and the receiver.
* [Interpreter](Interpreter)
    * How to define a grammar for simple languages and how to interpret them.
* [Iterator](Iterator)
    * Let us access elements of a data structure without exposing its structure.
* [Mediator](Mediator)
    * Provides an obj to let objs communicate in a decoupled way.
* [Memento](Memento)
    * Let us capture the state of an obj, a sort of snapshot of it.
* [Observer](Observer)
    * When one obj change state all the observers get notified.
* [State](State)
    * Allows an obj to change behavior depending on its state.
* [Strategy](Strategy)
    * Encapsulates a family of algorithms in objs.
* [Template Method](TemplateMethod)
    * Let us define the skeleton of an algorithm, leaving its concrete implementation
to subclasses.
* [Visitor](Visitor)
    * It allows to perform certain operations on the nodes of an object structure.
