# Structural Patterns

They are used to compose objects to form larger structures.

* [Adapter](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/StructuralPatterns/Adapter)
    * It is used to make two incompatible interfaces work together
* [Bridge](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/StructuralPatterns/Bridge)
    * It is used to to provide a stable interface with changing implementations.
* [Composite](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/StructuralPatterns/Composite)
    * Let us treat many related objects like the same one.
* [Decorator](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/StructuralPatterns/Decorator)
    * Let us to add responsibilities to objects without subclassing.
* [Facade](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/StructuralPatterns/Facade)
    * Provides a single interface to a series of other ones.
* [Flyweight](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/StructuralPatterns/Flyweight)
    * Let us to share a pool/map/cache of objects to lower the number of objects created.
* [Proxy](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/StructuralPatterns/Proxy)
    * Let us control access to an object and create an expensive obj only on demand.
