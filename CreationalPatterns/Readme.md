# Creational Patterns

They are used to make a system independent of how its objects are created or
composed.

* [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/CreationalPatterns/AbstractFactory)
    * Interface for creating families of products (even not necessarily related).
    * Many classes produced.
* [Builder](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/CreationalPatterns/Builder)
    * Used for complex objects.
* [Factory Method](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/CreationalPatterns/FactoryMethod)
    * Easily customizable code.
    * Often used as standard, and initial pattern.
    * One method is used to create objects that share an interface.
* [Prototype](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/CreationalPatterns/Prototype)
    * Create new objects by copying.
* [Singleton](https://github.com/telapo/design_patterns/tree/master/CreationalPatterns/Singleton)
    * Make sure there is only one instance of a certain class.
