## Additional Patterns linked to Java 8 in particular


* conditional deferred execution 
    * if we have to query the sate of an object many times only to call one of its method, it is advisable to create a new one
* execute around 
    * if the same code is often surrounded by preparation and cleanup code
* strategy 
    * there is a family of algos and we choose among them
* template method 
    * define outline of algo but change certain parts of it
* observer 
    * one object the subject needs to notify a list of other objects (observers) when something happens
* chain of responsibility 
    * one processing object does some work and passes the result to another object
* factory
    * create objects without exposing the instantiation logic
